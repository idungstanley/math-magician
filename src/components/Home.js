        Welcome every morning with a smile. Look on the new day as another

        what you were unable to finish yesterday. Be a self-starter. Let your
        first hour set the theme of success and positive action that is certain
        to echo through your entire day. Today will never happen again. Dont
        waste it with a false start or no start at all. You were not born to
        fail.
